 * is 48 texels of data, and the original goes up as those 48 with the tile in
 * the left 33 of them; every UV is normalised by the padded width. A pack
 * built for an emulator dumped the tile alone - 33 wide, scaled - and uploaded
 * over the 48 the tile's UVs show the left 33/48 of it: a stretch, on the few
 * hundred textures in a pack whose width is not a multiple of the line. Our
 * own dumps are the padded row and come back as they are.
 *
 * So an image that fits the padded shape is left alone, and anything else is
 * taken to be the tile: scaled onto a canvas of the padded shape at the same
 * scale, tile at the origin, with the edge repeated across the padding - the
 * clamp stops at the tile so it is never seen, and repeating the edge keeps
 * the filter from pulling black into the last texel.
 *
 * Returns the buffer to upload, which is either rep itself or a new one with

/**
 * A pack's opaque picture standing in for a texture the game draws with alpha.
 *
 * The XBLA release's art carries no alpha for most of the textures whose N64
 * original has some: its records for them are DXT1 or 8888 with 255 in every
 * pixel, and the console's renderer must have taken the shape from the game's
 * own texels, since the pictures draw right there. Uploaded as they are, a
 * light beam (an I8 gradient, whose alpha on the N64 *is* its intensity) is a
 * solid grey sheet, and every smoke puff, glare and cutout is a square. A Rice
 * pack missing the _a half of a split image has the same hole.
 *
 * So a replacement that is opaque in every pixel, for a texture whose own
 * texels are not, is given an alpha:
 *
 *   - an intensity texture's alpha is its intensity, so it comes from the
 *     picture's own luminance. That matches the picture where the release
 *     redrew it, which the original's alpha would not;
 *   - anything else takes the original's alpha, resampled onto the picture.
 *
 * Nothing changes for a picture that carries any alpha of its own, or for a
 * texture the game keeps at 255 throughout: an opaque wall stays one.
