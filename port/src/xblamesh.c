/**
 * Drawing the XBLA release's meshes in place of the game's display lists.
 * See xblamesh.h for what this is and what shapes it.
 *
 * Three stages, each of which can fail on its own and leave the game drawing
 * its own geometry:
 *
 *   * the package, opened once and kept - PackedSegFile's record table is 42KB
 *     and stays in memory, the 30MB of data behind it does not;
 *   * a model's nodes, matched against the release's copy of the same file as
 *     it loads, which is the only thing that says which mesh replaces what;
 *   * a mesh, read and turned into a display list the first time something
 *     asks to draw it, and kept for as long as the game runs. Two lists per
 *     group, in fact: the draws whose material carries alpha are a span of
 *     their own, so that a node the game draws a translucent list for can
 *     have one too.
 *
 * Nothing here is on the render thread's critical path except the display list
 * pointer it ends up branching to.

 * this runs from - so the walk ends at the head model's own root.
 *
 * The game names it: a head model's parts number its toggled pieces, and
 * `MODELPART_HEAD_HAT` (1) is the hair - `Cheadwlab`'s slab of it, the piece
 * that came out hanging in the air over the release's own short hair. 53 of
 * the 76 heads have one and the release gives **none** of the 53 a mesh id,
 * where it gives the sunglasses beside them one in 45 of the 51 heads that
 * have those. A piece 4J modelled gets a group; the hair never does, in any
 * head, because it is painted into the head itself.
 *
 * Two things this will not do, both of which the code it replaced did:
 *
 *   * **the sunglasses of the six heads the release left at zero**
 *     (`Cheadanka`, `Cheaddarling`, `Cheaddavec`, `Cheadfem_guard`,
 *     `Cheadjon`, `Cheadjonathan`) keep their own geometry. Nothing in the
 *     mesh replaces them, so suppressing them took a character's glasses off;
 *   * **a far LOD alternative** keeps its own geometry, hair included. The
 *     head a chr is drawn from past 6000 units is the game's own - of the
 *     132 ids the release gives a head, the 124 under a distance node are
 *     every one on an alternative that starts at 0 - so a distant head that
 *     lost its hair would just be bald. Only the alternative drawn where the
 *     mesh is drawn is the one the mesh has already.
 *
 * And it is asked of a head only. Part 1 is a toggle in one other model,
 * `MODELPART_DRCAROLL_0001`, and a part number means nothing outside the
 * skeleton that numbered it - so the model's skeleton is checked first. A
 * head's is the one skeleton the game never promotes to a pointer (there is no
 * `g_SkelHead` in `g_Skeletons[]`), so it is still the number `SKEL_HEAD` here,

 * never been looked at, and a register of loaded models to go back over is not
 * something that can be kept - a modeldef can be freed inside a stage and its
 * address handed out again, and walking one that has been is a wild pointer
 * away from a crash (it was: file 1369 in the G5 Building, whose rootnode had
 * become 0xbe0003ffe0 by the time the switch was flipped).
 *
 * So the work is done up front instead, and it is affordable: 55 models in the
 * G5 Building carry a mesh, matching them is a slot read and a tree walk each,
 * and five loads of the level with this always on and five with it gated came
 * out inside each other's run-to-run spread. What is *not* affordable is
 * unpacking a 250MB archive for somebody who only ever wanted the texture
 * pack, so this asks for the package only if there is one ready to read -
 * xblaMeshOpen(0). A player whose copy is still inside its .7z pays for the
 * unpack the first time they switch the meshes on, and from the next level
 * load onwards is in the same place as everybody else.

 * The state one draw's material asks for, written into the list.
 *
 * The material word is a Textures.raw record in its low 13 bits and an alpha
 * flag in bit 15 - the flag is exactly the records whose format carries alpha,
 * which is what says it is a flag and not part of the number. The two bytes
 * above that are not understood and are not read here.
 *
 * A record that will not bind - no package, or a number past the table - draws
 * shaded and untextured, which is what the whole mesh looked like before any
 * of this. So a texture that cannot be found costs that one material rather
 * than the mesh.
 *
 * What a material does *not* write is the combiner, the cycle type and the
 * render mode. Those belong to the node, because they are how a Perfect Dark
 * model is lit: there is no G_LIGHTING in it anywhere. modelRenderNodeDl()
 * writes, round each of its own lists, a two-cycle combiner against the
 * environment colour and a G_RM_FOG_PRIM_A blend towards the fog colour, and
 * the fog colour is the prop's shade colour - the room's brightness and the
 * floor's colour, as propCalculateShadeColour() worked them out. A list that
 * wrote a one-cycle texture-times-shade in their place, as this one did, drew
 * every mesh at full brightness in the darkest room, which was the "the XBLA
 * models are not affected by lights, they stay bright" report.
 * xblaMeshRenderNode() writes the same state the game writes for the node,
 * and the list leaves it alone.
 *
 * The fading span is the one exception and carries its own combiner: a beam
 * of light is not lit by the room, and the game's combiner reads the vertex
 * alpha as (texel - env) * alpha + env, which would turn the beam's zero into
 * the environment colour, opaque. G_CC_PASS2 in the second cycle keeps it
 * right under whichever cycle type the node left behind.
 *
 * Tile 1 is declared as a copy of tile 0, as texWriteTileLods() does for a
 * texture with one level: the props' combiner is G_CC_TRILERP, and the lod
 * fraction this port feeds it runs 0.7 to 1.0, so TEXEL1 is most of what a
 * prop draws with. Left undeclared it is whatever the last texture the game
 * loaded left there.

 * span to ride on.
 *
 * The same span takes a draw whose fade is in its texture rather than its
 * vertices: a material whose picture has next to no opaque texel (the comhub's
 * screen glow, record 4134, never reaches 108; a tinted pane at a flat 104; a

 * 95% of them write a second bone they do not have, and the third weight is
 * what is left of one and is zero outright on many. Applying all three anyway
 * is three matrix transforms for an answer that one or two of them already
 * gave: 44% of the release's skinned vertices come down to a single bone and
 * 34% to two, so this takes 41% of the transforms out of every posed frame.
 *
 * Done once, here, rather than per vertex per frame: the palette index is
 * clamped to the palette (which the pose did per vertex per frame), repeated
 * bones have their weights added together, zero-weight terms are dropped, and
 * what is left is counted into the fourth byte - which the file used for
 * something that was never a count.
 *
 * **Only weights that are exactly zero.** A third weight written as the
 * remainder of the other two lands a hair off zero rather than on it about
 * 15% of the time, and dropping those as well would take another tenth of the
 * transforms; it is not done, because a term that small still moves the
 * rounded vertex by one step of the write wherever it falls either side of a
 * half, and the pose is worth more as something that can be shown to be
 * unchanged than as something a tenth faster. Merging a repeat is safe on the
 * same measure: it adds the two weights before the transform instead of after
 * it, which is the same sum in a different order, and the difference is a
 * float's last place against a write that rounds to a sixteenth of a unit.

 * 32x32 stand-in: the same share of each picture the rooms sample.
 *

 * the matte metal of it, which keeps a grip that cannot be told apart from the
 * barrel from out-shining it. A third-person model with reflections of its
 * own keeps them.
 *
 * The pairing is the game's own: the weapon whose third-person model
 * (playermgrGetModelOfWeapon()) is this file, and that weapon's hi_model. The
 * first-person file names its meshes the way every model does
 * (xblaMeshFileMeshSlots()), and the amount is read off those meshes' draws.

 * character here is eleven thousand vertices, which would push a match's worth
 * of chrs straight through the end of it. This is its own arena, doubled the
 * way the game doubles its pools - the display list built this frame is run
 * while the next one is being built, so last frame's vertices have to survive
 * one more frame.
 *
 * **It grows by adding a chunk, never by growing one.** The obvious arena - one
 * block per side, `realloc`ed to fit - cannot be grown inside a frame at all,
 * because a `realloc` moves vertices that commands already written this frame
 * point at. So it grew between frames instead, to whatever the frame before it
 * asked for, and the frame that first wanted more than that drew the tail of
 * its meshes in their **bind pose**: for a head, whose bind vertices are in the
 * body's space around y 1400, a head hanging a body's height above the body for
 * one frame. That is every frame a character first comes into view, 12 of them
 * over 3000 frames of an eight-simulant match.
 *
 * A chunk list has neither problem. What has been handed out never moves, so a
 * chunk can be added in the middle of a frame, and a frame that wants more than
 * has ever been wanted gets it there and then rather than one frame late. Each
 * side keeps its own chunks and hands them back at the top of its next frame;
 * they are not freed, because the cap is what bounds this and what a match
 * actually holds is small: one chunk a side for eight simulants, six for

 * that reaches the screen. The vertices stay inside the s16 as long as the
 * mesh does, so how far the pose can be taken is what the pose *reaches*.

 * 0.006: in the N64's s15.16 that keeps two and a half decimal digits, and
 * against vertices written sixteen times larger the error is sixteen times
 * the game's own - a few pixels on a gun held at arm's length, snapping as
 * the pose turns. See xblaMeshPose().
 *
 * Which is bounded without posing anything. A posed vertex is a blend of one
 * bind position put through each of the palette's matrices, and a blend of
 * points inside a box carried through an affine matrix is inside that box's
 * image - so the eight corners of the bind box, through every palette entry,
 * bound every vertex this is about to write. Cheap: 24 entries at most, eight
 * corners each, once a frame per mesh.
 *
 * The cap is 16 because it is already far past what the mesh states - a
 * sixteenth of a unit is a millimetre and a half of a person - and because a
 * bound that is met exactly still has to leave the rounding somewhere to go.

/**
 * Whether a node from another model is one this model is drawing.
 *
 * Perfect Dark keeps a character's head in a model file of its own and hangs
 * it off the body at a `HEADSPOT` node: `modelApplyHeadRelations()` makes the
 * head's root a child of that node and gives the head's top level nodes the
 * body node as their parent. So a head's display list reaches
 * `modelRenderNodeDl()` with the *body's* model and the *head's* modeldef, and
 * the definition check above would throw every head away - which is what used
 * to leave a release body under an N64 head.
 *
 * Walking up to the model's own root through a `HEADSPOT` is what says the
 * node has been grafted into this tree rather than being a stale address that
 * happens to hash here, so this replaces the definition check rather than
 * skipping it. A head is the only thing the game grafts - every `->parent`
 * the renderer writes is a headspot's - so a walk that reaches the root
 * without passing one is a node of this model's own tree and no business of
 * an entry that was filed under another model. The walk is a head's depth
 * plus the body's, both small; the bound is what stops a parent chain that is
 * being rewritten from going round for ever.

 * off to nothing at the edge. The mirror still carries every other change the
 * game makes to the tables - a burn's darkening - but not their alpha on a
 * skinned mesh, which is the bullets'.
 *
 * The chr combiner multiplies the blood tint by the vertex colour
 * (G_CC_CUSTOM_18), and the release bakes dark vertex colours where the N64's
 * are near white, so a wound on a dark shirt came out the colour of the shirt.
 * A wounded vertex is lifted towards white by how wounded it is, and the
 * reflection passes are scaled down by the same: blood does not shine, and the
 * sheen added over a wound washed it back to the cloth.
 *
 * The wounds are kept per model and forgotten when the model's stock tables

 * the model and hands each list under a hit box to bgTestHitOnChr(). With the
 * release's mesh drawn in the stock lists' place that meant a guard was shot
 * at the N64's body - the release's hair, shoulders or coat could be hit
 * only where the N64's happened to be.
 *
 * So the walk asks xblaMeshHitSkipsNode() about each list it passes: a list
 * that draws nothing (covered, or the hair the mesh paints on) is not tested,
 * and a list that draws a group of the mesh is noted. After the walk
 * xblaMeshHitTest() poses the noted meshes the way xblaMeshPose() does, from
 * the same matrices bgTestHitOnChr() reads - so the triangles land in the
 * shot's own space with nothing to convert - and tests them with the game's
 * own triangle routine. The nearer of that and any stock list still drawn
 * (a far LOD alternative, a piece the release left alone) is the hit.
 *
 * A body is one mesh on one node, so the part a hit counts as cannot come
 * from where the list sits in the tree the way the game's does: it comes from
 * the bone the hit triangle hangs off, as the bbox node on that bone's matrix,
 * and from the bbox nearest the hit where a bone has none. The damage a head
 * shot does depends on it.
 *
 * Not reached when the game tests boxes only - two or more human players
